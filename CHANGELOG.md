- **BREAKING**: Remove old command names (`/aidd-idea`, `/aidd-generate`, `/aidd-finalize`)
- **BREAKING**: Remove old role files (`architect.md`, `implementer.md`)
- **BREAKING**: Only v3 naming conventions supported
- Require migration to v3 before upgrade

---

## [2.4.0] - 2026-01-19

### ✨ Added - Migration Mode

**Phase 2 Complete**: Full migration mode support for naming conventions

#### New Commands (aliases, fully functional)
- `/aidd-analyze` - alias for `/aidd-idea` (PRD creation)
- `/aidd-code` - alias for `/aidd-generate` (code generation)
- `/aidd-validate` - alias for `/aidd-finalize` (quality & deploy)
- `/aidd-plan-feature` - alias for `/aidd-feature-plan` (feature planning)

#### New Agent Roles (aliases, fully functional)
- `planner.md` - alias for `architect.md`
- `coder.md` - alias for `implementer.md`

#### Artifact Structure Versioning
- `naming_version` field in `.pipeline-state.json` controls artifact paths
- **v2 (default)**: Old structure - `prd/`, `architecture/`, `plans/`, `reports/`
- **v3 (opt-in)**: New structure - `_analysis/`, `_plans/`, `_validation/`

#### Migration Tools
- `scripts/migrate-naming-v3.py` - automated migration from v2 to v3
  - Renames artifact folders
  - Removes duplication in filenames (`{name}-prd.md` → `{name}.md`)
  - Updates `.pipeline-state.json`
  - Updates references in documents

#### Documentation
- Updated all command files to support `naming_version`
- Added migration guide: `docs/naming-v3-implementation.md`
- Added completion summary: `contributors/2026-01-19-phase2-completion-summary.md`
- Updated roles map: `contributors/2026-01-19-aidd-roles-commands-artifacts-map.md`
- Updated `CLAUDE.md` with migration mode section

### 🔄 Changed

#### Commands
All commands now check `naming_version` and create artifacts accordingly:
- `/aidd-analyze` (ea568ca) - `prd/` → `_analysis/`
- `/aidd-research` (c0ec969) - `research/` → `_research/`
- `/aidd-plan` (f9c810e) - `architecture/` → `_plans/mvp/`
- `/aidd-plan-feature` (6e84bbc) - `plans/` → `_plans/features/`
- `/aidd-validate` (e56630d) - `reports/` → `_validation/`

#### File Naming Convention
- **v2**: Duplication in names - `{date}_{FID}_{slug}-prd.md`, `{slug}-plan.md`
- **v3**: No duplication - `{date}_{FID}_{slug}.md`

### ✅ Backward Compatibility

- **100% backward compatible** - no breaking changes
- All old commands continue to work
- All old role files continue to work
- Existing v2 projects work without modification
- Can use old and new command names interchangeably

### 📊 Metrics

- **5/5 commands** support dual-mode (100%)
- **2/2 roles** have aliases (planner, coder)
- **6 commits** in Phase 2.3
- **~300+ lines** of documentation updated
- **8 files** modified (5 commands + 2 docs + 1 script)
